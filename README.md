## Plan on improving the project

Google Maps Integration: Embed a Google Map on the homepage or contact page, displaying the coffee shop’s location with a clickable "Get Directions" button. This makes it easy for customers to find the shop and navigate there directly, especially for those visiting for the first time.

Online Ordering: Set up an online menu where customers can customize their orders, such as selecting drink sizes, milk types, or add-ons. This feature can integrate with payment processors like PayPal or Stripe, allowing customers to place orders in advance for pickup or delivery.

Customizable Sections for the Owner: Allow the owner to easily update the website’s content, such as changing the menu items, updating prices, or adding daily specials. This could be done through a simple admin panel or a content management system, giving the owner control over the site’s updates without needing technical expertise.
